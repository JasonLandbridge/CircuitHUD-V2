Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2021-03-21
  Changes:
    - HUGE UPDATE BUT FULLY COMPATIBLE! See mod page for more info!
    - HUD Combinators now have signal filtering functionality, this avoids long chains of arithmetic combinators to get the right signal display!
    - HUD Combinators now have a preview of all the signals that are coming in, this greatly helps when picking which filters to set!
    - The HUD now has buttons for each HUD Combinator, which means you can now edit from anywhere, zoom to the combinator and hide each individual HUD Combinator!
    - You can now search and filter for HUD Combinators straight from the HUD itself (Thanks @Taurondir for the idea!)
    - Greatly improved the size and position control of the HUD!
    - Added more helpful messages in the HUD based on the HUD Combinator state!
    - Player specific settings are no longer set in the Mod settings but are now configurable from the Circuit HUD directly (Thanks @AngrySlipper for the idea!)
    - The combinators in the HUD can now be sorted by name, build order and priority in both ascending and descending mode.
    - Added hotkeys for Toggeling the HUD (default: "CONTROL + SHIFT + S") and opening the settings window (default: "CONTROL + ALT + S")
    - Mining the HUD Combinator now takes 3 seconds, up from 0.1 to prevent accidental mining.
    - Each player can now change their individual HUD update time in real time from the settings menu.
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the collapsed button going off-screen when UI Scale is above 100%
    - The HUD now automatically expands when changing the HUD position in the settings
    - Fixed many HUD glitches, should be much more fluid and stable now with better alignment, especially in the bottom-right corner.
    - Fixed the HUD Combinator GUI and Settings GUI not closing on pressing Escape and E.
    - The HUD Combinator GUI now has the correct name as the title, and updates on confirm.
  Optimisations:
    - Major refactor, mainly ensuring less methods are stored on the lua global level and that most methods are now in a wrapping object. Also deleted unused methods and empty files.
    - Now uses Factorio Library for better migration management
    - Simplyfied the HUD size calculation greatly with better alignment results, improving performance greatly!
